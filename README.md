# Multiclassification-of-Lung-Cancer

ü´Å Lung Cancer Subtype Classification using CNN
Overview

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a profound impact on global public health. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes and informing treatment decisions. This project presents a robust and accurate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed for the multiclass classification of lung cancer subtypes using medical imaging data.

The model is trained to distinguish among various lung cancer types, including but not limited to:

    Adenocarcinoma

    Squamous Cell Carcinoma

    Large Cell Carcinoma

By supporting early-stage detection and diagnosis, this system aims to assist radiologists and pathologists with valuable insights to guide personalized treatment strategies.
üéØ Objectives

    Develop a deep learning pipeline for the classification of lung cancer subtypes from medical imaging data.

    Facilitate accurate, early-stage diagnosis to improve clinical decision-making and patient care.
